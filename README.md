## Briefly about the project

We wanted to create a dictionary app which helps us to learn new English words. Originally, we made a board game which was a fancy way to improve our English skills and later we decided that we would like to develop an application to replace the board game. This app currently contains a game mode where the players can fight against each other for the trophy, and two practice modes for the words and grammaratical structures, and an admin page-like ui where the user can manage their words.

**DISCLAIMER:**

**The application lacks some of the technologies that are required in a business app**, because it is originally made for personal usage. Please keep this in your mind when you are checking the code.

Some of the missing parts(without further ado):

-   There is no full-scale error handling in the application
-   There is no logging service
-   There are no unit tests

## Config & Install

You need to install the **NODE JS with TypeScript** and set the IDEA to start the project with npm start command or type it manually at every app launch. To run the app in the development mode, please open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

**IMPORTANT INFORMATION:**

**You also need to download the back-end and the shared-repository of this application.**

All the folders of repos have to be in the same folder so that the references can work properly.
